			<td><p style="color: blue">Union officials say the
					Lordstown, Ohio, plant near Cleveland and the Fairfax plant in
					Kansas City, Kansas, will close for as many as five weeks in June
					and July. The company confirmed that some car factories would be
					shut down longer than usual but would not give details. Lordstown
					makes the Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan, while Fairfax builds the
					Chevrolet Malibu midsize car. The additional shutdowns come as all
					automakers struggle to deal with a shrinking U.S. market that is
					dramatically shifting away from cars toward trucks and SUVs of all
					sizes. Some are continuing to produce cars and selling them to
					rental car companies or offering big discounts to individual buyers
					while others are cutting production.</p></td>
